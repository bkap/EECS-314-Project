\maketitle
We will be implementing a reverse Polish calculator in MIPS assembly.
The calculator will take expressions in reverse Polish notation from
standard input, compute the result, and print it to standard output.
The calculator will support addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, exponentiation, roots, and the basic trigonometric
functions: $\sin$, $\cos$, $\tan$, $\sec$, $\csc$, and $\cot$.  The
$\sin$ function will be implemented with the Taylor series and the
other functions will be computed relative to $\sin$.  The calculator
will support operations on arbitrary integers and single-precision
floating point numbers.

The project will be divided in two parts.  The first part is IO,
addition/subtraction, and multiplication.  Andrew Johnson and Frankie
Lutikoff will be responsible for this part.  The second part is
division, exponentiation, roots, and trigonometric functions.  Ben
Kaplan and Jacob Emmert-Aronson will be responsible for this part.

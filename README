PROJECT:

* Floating point calculator
    * capable of 4 basic operations, exponents, trig functions, inverse trig functions, and logarithms
    * postfix notation
    * double precision


Things to figure out:
    
    1) Need to handle the user entering numbers with more than 20 characters

    2) Need to come up with a procedure for errors. What do we display in the
    event of a NaN, +/- infinity, div by 0, and so on.

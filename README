PROJECT:

* Floating point calculator
    * capable of 4 basic operations, exponents, and trig functions
    * prefix notation
    * double precision


Things to figure out:
    1) Need to find a way to get from the normal registers to the float
    registers for calculating the number. The ops work with either one set of
    registers or the other, so I don't know how to get between them other than
    writing the bits I need to memory with sw and reading it with ldcl

    2) Need to discuss the use of the floating point registers. The best way to
    do this would be to treat each operation as a function. In order for this
    to work, we need to separate the 32 registers into temps, saves, func args,
    and return values (similar to the way the normal registers are divided,
    except we don't lose 1/4th of the registers)

    3) Need to come up with a procedure for errors. What do we display in the
    event of a NaN, +/- infinity, div by 0, and so on.
